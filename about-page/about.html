                <h2 id="hi">Hi!</h2>
                <p>We’re Sage and Rowan, founders of <b>two Girls one Charm</b> — your friendly supernatural sanitation squad.</p>
                <p>We’ve been best friends since our days at St Agatha’s Home for Unclaimed Children. While most kids were learning their ABCs, we were swapping salt circle techniques and debating the best essential oils for spirit banishment.</p>
                <p>After one too many “incidents” (RIP, St Agatha’s East Wing), we realised we had a calling: keeping other people’s homes from catching fire — metaphysically and literally. So we packed up our salt, sage, and questionable life choices and hit the road.</p>
                <p>Now we help clients across the country deal with all varieties of spiritual squatters — from cranky basement spectres to full-on demonic drama queens. We don’t claim to talk to ghosts — we just convince them, politely but firmly, that it’s time to move along.</p>

                <h3>Our Origin Story</h3><p id="parenthetical-text">(the important stuff)</p>
                <h4>2010 — the Forbidden Attic</h4>
                <p>We discoverd St Agatha’s attic was haunted by an elderly Victorian ghost who taught us the basics of warding, banishment, and how to properly brew tea in a kettle that absolutely should not have still functioned.</p>
                <h4>2015 — Our first paid job</h4>
                <p>A neighbour offerd us £10 to convince a poltergeist to stop rearranging her garden gnomes. We succeed (barely). The poltergeist left a thank-you note and a single, unsettlingly warm pebble.</p>
                <h4>2022 — two Girls one Charm is born</h4>
                <p>We filed as an Independent Supernatural Sanitation Service. Sage designed the logo. Rowan wrote the health-and-safety documentation in Latin, out of spite.</p>
                <h4>2023 — the First Major case</h4>
                <p>A wyrd basement entity tried to crawl through a client’s washing machine. Sage distracted it with scented candles; Rowan bound it with a perfect containment sigil. We celebrate with curry and some new notebooks.</p>
                <h4>2024 — Business booms</h4>
                <p>Word somehow started to spread. We got hired for hauntings, demon tantrums, ghost therapy, and “general vibes clean-up.” We upgraded our kit, adopted a semi-haunted book, and sort of became the neighbourhood go-to supernatural fixers.</p>
                <h4>2025 — Present day</h4>
                <p>two Girls one Charm now handles everything from mischievous Myrlings to full poltergeist melodrama. We don’t claim to banish everything — just convince entities, kindly but firmly, that it’s time to move along.</p>

                        the darkest hauntings. She believes every spirit deserves closure — and every cleansing deserves flair. When 
                        she’s not banishing ghosts, she’s knitting charm pouches for stray cats.

                    <p class="co-founderAbout">Stoic, sharp-eyed, and fluent in Latin insults, Rowan handles the heavy banishing work with 
                        surgical precision. She’s quiet until she isn’t — and when she speaks, the entities listen. Despite her deadpan 
                        exterior, she’d burn a circle of salt around the world for Sage.
